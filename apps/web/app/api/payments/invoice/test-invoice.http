### Test Invoice Endpoint
# You can use this with REST Client extension in VS Code or curl

### 1. Create Invoice (requires authentication)
POST http://localhost:3000/api/payments/invoice
Content-Type: application/json
Cookie: your-auth-cookie-here

{
  "plan_id": "your-plan-uuid",
  "quantity": 1,
  "price_amount": 10.00,
  "price_currency": "usd",
  "pay_currency": "btc",
  "order_description": "Test Payment"
}

### 2. Alternative using curl with auth token
# curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/payments/invoice \
#   -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
#   -H "Cookie: your-auth-cookie" \
#   -d '{
#     "plan_id": "uuid",
#     "quantity": 1,
#     "price_amount": 10.00,
#     "price_currency": "usd",
#     "pay_currency": "btc"
#   }'
